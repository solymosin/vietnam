Using WorldClim projections (https://www.worldclim.org/data/cmip6/cmip6_clim10m.html#google_vignette)
for 10 GCM and four SSP combination the mean of the predicted bioclimatic variables (https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html) for Vietnamian provinces were estimated and saved in ESRI shape files.
The ESRI shape file name contains the following structure:

the projected climate for ACCESS-CM2 GCM and ssp126 emission scenario between 2041 and 2060 is save in folder wc2.1_10m_bioc_ACCESS-CM2_ssp126_2041-2060
