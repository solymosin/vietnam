In the WP3 the plan was: "Molecular dentification of Trypanosoma spp, Anaplasma spp, Babesia spp, Theileria spp in host (cattle, buffaloes, goats, and horses) and in vectors (ticks and flies); and molecular identification of vector species."

But as in the metagenome analysis we found further eukaryote pathogens the list was extended as:
Acanthamoeba spp, Babesia spp, Edhazardia spp, Entamoeba spp, Plasmodium spp, Sarcocystis spp, Theileria spp, Trichomonas spp, Trypanosoma spp. AND Anaplasma spp.

After blasting the assemlby-generated contigs, only Trypanosoma hits were confirmed (qcovs>80, pident>90) among the genus tested.
In the sample FR11 we found 295 contigs (FR11_S85_Trypanosoma.fa) having the full length 126,184 bp, with maximum contig length 4075 assorted to Trypanosoma, from which 293 was Trypanosoma theileri best matched.
In the sample FR15 we found 37 contigs (FR15_S89_Trypanosoma.fa) having the full length 14,319 bp, with maximum contig length 637 assorted to Trypanosoma, from which 35 was Trypanosoma theileri best matched.
In the sample FR17 we found 30 contigs (FR17_S91_Trypanosoma.fa) having the full length 148,80 bp, with maximum contig length 728 assorted to Trypanosoma, from which 20 was Trypanosoma theileri best matched.
In the sample HNV_07_S2022_NAGY_M we found 3 contigs (HNV_07_S2022_NAGY_M_Trypanosoma.fa) having the full length 1,828 bp, with maximum contig length 762 assorted to Trypanosoma, from which 1 was Trypanosoma theileri best matched, 1 Trypanosoma kuseli and 1 Trypanosoma vivax Y486.
